# Armstrong Numbers

A number is an Armstrong Number or narcissistic number if it is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power
of the number of digits.

## Example:

a.) 123 is an armstrong number.

```
(1^3) + (2^3) + (3^3) = 36
```

b.) 153 is an armstrong number.

```
(1^3) + (5^3) + (3^3) = 153
```

c.) 407 is also an armstrong number.

```
(4^3) + (0^3) + (7^3) = 407
```

## Task

Write a program that will display all Armstrong number from 100 to 1000
